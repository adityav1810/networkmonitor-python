# Network Monitor

## About Project 
This Project was part of our end semester evaluation for the Computer Networks Course (ECSE207L)
In todayâ€™s tech driven digital world where security of
your privacy is a major concern, it becomes very
important to monitor where the traffic on your
website comes from. For providing better experience
to their users, website owners constantly need to
make improvements in their websites. Monitoring
network packets can help them understand their
visitors better and hence improve their content based
on this data.
## Objectives

Application
Intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital
network or part of a network

Analyze and classify that information based on
protocols they follow
